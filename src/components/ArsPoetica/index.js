            Understanding a language is an issue of fluency followed by
            interpretation. Language has a history of confounding us, and
            being misinterpreted and mistranslated. With the emergence of
            computers and their integration into our everyday lives, I question
            what such a close connection between mankind and technology will mean
            for our comprehension of language.

          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            Language is a constant struggle towards clarity and accuracy. In our
            attempts to learn and develop programming languages, we find the same
            qualities: places of intended/unintended evasiveness, an attempt at
            structure, a cadence.
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            Human language comes with its own properties that can lead to
            misunderstandings&#8212;
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            How loosely can a word be used to the point where it is being used incorrectly?
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            To what point is the pronunciation of a word incorrect?
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            How much energy and meaning can be packed into a sentence until it has
            lost clarity and, occasionally, its intended meaning?
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            How does tone of voice and context influence our understanding
            of the same words across different circumstances?
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            In response to these possible limitations, I ask where we see these
            aspects erased/magnified/emulated in programming languages.
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>
            Programming a machine is a state of mind, placing the mind into a
            body that functions and behaves completely unlike that of a human.
            Unawareness of the nuances of the machine can culminate in a program
            gone awry or ineffective. Maybe there is something to be said of the
            process of learning a programming language: returning to a state of
            baseness, scouring the machine’s anatomy and processes to the point
            where we can confidently direct it via language. Through this path
            perhaps we can see the potential in undoing and rebuilding ourselves.

            This project attempts to explore the connecting threads and the
            distinctions between machine-based language and human language,
            performed through several approaches, including the disassembly
            of language of the “human” realm and piecing it into something
            digestible for a computer, reflections on living in the age of
            the Internet, and interpreting the natural world through programming
            concepts and heuristics.
          </p>
          <p className={'start-indent'}>

            In the structure and syntax of the programming language, which lies
            at the intersection of human and machine-based language, is there
            space for humans to find more or less clarity, a different means
            of expression? What will become of us in light of our co-dependence
            with the machine?
