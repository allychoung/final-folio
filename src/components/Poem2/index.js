              Open a laptop to whitened skin and chiseled limbs<br/>
              What more is there to consume?<br/><br/>

              Infinite images, some bashful, some horrid<br/>
              Shuffle and reveal upon request<br/><br/>

              An image of us is tucked away somewhere<br/>
              I don’t know what to make of it—How many unknown eyes have skimmed me over<br/><br/>

              On screens that render me by the bit, my expression fixed<br/>
              Looking out at no one<br/><br/>

              I spend a lifetime at a desk. I always have one more to spare<br/>
              What of it? I succumb to the void, linger and pass the days there<br/><br/>

              We all have things to say. Spit them out!<br/>
              The machine translates them to bits and can render them back to meaning, over and over<br/><br/>

              I wonder how everyone can sleep at night knowing<br/>
              Every bitter moment is neatly stored<br/><br/>

              Somewhere thousands of miles away
