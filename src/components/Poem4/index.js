            <p>
              I am captivated I am beholden I lay waste to the sea with my prowess
              as I storm the tempest and joust her. I don’t tarry I don’t squander
              what I am given. I allocate myself I wield authority as I am permitted
              as I see fit. I don’t take this in stride I don’t even have the time to
              further this myself and we will take our time. I don’t see an alternative
              it never crosses my mind that there is one. I don’t think think think for
              myself or for her I don’t see it turning out any other way I don’t have the
              time I don’t seek your pity or see your sorrow I don’t possess such facilities.
              I don’t think of this as a joke nor a game nor an opportunity I just seek
              what I I just seek Where does the tyrant go where does he find the
              time to take down his armor. Where is there space? For me, I find
              it amusing to say that I don’t think too much ahead there is something
              always doing that work for me I manage to lay out the right path for
              myself in time yet it is never my doing can never be I am made to be
              mastered I am made to be conquered. There is a little door at the side
              of the room my chamber my skull what would become of me if it opened.
              I don’t even think there is room for I don’t even think there is a space
              for the possibility.
